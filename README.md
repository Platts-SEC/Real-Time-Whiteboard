#Whiteboard App
An online collaborative whiteboard app which people can use to share ideas, tutor others etc. It enables users to write text, draw shapes,graphs etc and share their ideas with each other in real-time. We are using a JavaScript framework called Paper.js to build the main drawing tool in HTML5 Canvas and Firebase for the back-end. Paper.js allows us to uniquely determine curves using segments. A segment is a collection of three points, namely the anchor point, incoming handle and the outgoing handle. Every curve can be represented as a unique set of segments. This makes storing data in the database really easy as we only have to store the segments of the curves.
